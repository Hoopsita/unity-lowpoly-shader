# Unity Low-poly Shader

This shader is a simple way to render your meshes in the lowpoly style.

I have developed it for an upcoming game, and there's no point in keeping it just for myself - especially since I know tons of people are looking for a lowpoly shader, but there isn't a viable free option available.

## Usage

To use it, just change the shader of a material to `Pavel Kou≈ôil/LowPoly`. It takes the textures and converts them to the lowpoly style based on center of UV coordinates of a face.

HOWEVER, there are some limitations:

- It doesn't work for Unity terrain.
- Sometimes the lowpoly shaded face will look ugly because of the way UV coordinates are used for coloring face. Modifying the texture will fix this.
- Only one light is supported at the moment.

Fixing the lights and adding support for Unity terrain is definitely on my todo list, but if you need it ASAP, it's better to just send a pull request!

## Requirements

- Unity 5.4 (it might also work on other versions, I just didn't test it)
- D3D10 graphics card (you need Geometry Shaders for this to work)

## Contributing

Contributing is definitely welcome! All you need to do is send a pull request with your patch.

*PS: Just don't forget to add a test scene (similiar to the already existing test scenes in `Tests` folder) with the specific scenario you wanted to accomplish. This will help others doing contributions check that they didn't break anything that worked previously. :)*
